### CPSC 120

* [Lab 7](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-07-bryan-and-partner) 

Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I felt challenged in this lab. It was our first difficult assignment. And it helped bring me and my partner together to complete the assignment using teamwork and communication. It was also fun seeing the program run and seeing that my hard work paid off.

* [Lab 10 ](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-10-kevin-and-partner) 

Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs because it was our first image that we have ever created. This allowed us to learn new things about creating and uploading images. It was fun working with partners to create something new and exciting.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-bryan-agredano-1) 

Lab 8, part 3 was another favorite of mine because we used vectors and if stream and the get function to make animations using text characters. This was fun to work on because I didn't know it was possible to create animations like that. It also made it more fun to work on with a partner because it allowed us to enjoy what we were working on.
